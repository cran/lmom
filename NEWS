Version 2.2     2014 Jan 13

   o   Now explicitly imports standard packages "stats" and "graphics".

   o   pelp() and pelq() gain an argument 'subdiv'.

   o   In samlmu() and samlmu.s(), computation of trimmed L-moments is faster
       for small degrees of trimming.

   o   Help file for pelwak() now notes the difference between its behaviour
       and that of the corresponding routine in the LMOMENTS Fortran package.

   o   Fixed: lmrp() could, in rare cases, attempt to evaluate 'pfunc' with an
       argument outside the user-supplied bounds.

   o   Fixed: lmrp(...,order=1,verbose=TRUE) would fail with error
       "in data.frame( ... : 'row.names' should specify one of the variables".

       In versions 1.6 and earlier, lmrq(...,order=1,verbose=TRUE) would fail
       with the same error.  In versions 2.0 and later this was masked by the
       following bug ...

   o   Fixed: since version 2.0, lmrq(...,order=1) would fail with error
       "if (denom>0 ... : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed".

       pelq(...,type="s"), which calls lmrq(...,order=1) internally, would fail
       with the same error.

   o   Fixed: since version 2.0, samlmu() could give an error in some cases
       when 'nmom' exceeded the number of non-missing values in 'x'.


Version 2.1     2013 Jun 19

   o   Removed Fortran 2003 features from the Fortran code used by lmrp() and
       lmrq(), to enable compilation by CRAN for Macintosh OS.


Version 2.0     2013 Jun 17

   o   Some support added for trimmed L-moments: samlmu(), samlmu.s(), lmrp(),
       lmrq(), pelp(), and pelq() each gain an argument 'trim'.

   o   Some support added for computing L-moments rather than L-moment ratios:
       samlmu(), samlmu.s(), lmrp(), lmrq(), pelp(), and pelq() each gain an
       argument 'ratios'.

   o   New function .samlmu() for fast computation of (untrimmed) L-moment
       ratios.

   o   lmrp() and lmrq() use an internal function for numerical integration,
       to avoid the bugs present in R's own integrate() function in R versions
       2.12.0 through 3.0.1.

   o   In lmrp(), modified the computation method for lambda_1: should make
       computations a little faster.

   o   LICENSE file no longer included in package, to avoid a NOTE when
       building the package for CRAN under R version 3.0.0.  The license can
       be found at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html.


Version 1.6     2012 Jan 23

   o   In lmrd(), the framing box and the lines at x=0 and y=0 are drawn in
       colour 'par("fg")'.  The lines for distributions "GEV" and "PE3" use
       less bright colours.

   o   In lmrd(), argument 'legend.lmrd' can be a list of arguments to legend().

   o   In lmrd() there is a small change to the default position of the legend,
       ensuring that if a legend box is drawn (via the argument
       'legend=list(bty="o")'), its top left corner is offset by 45 degrees
       from the top left corner of the plot.

   o   Removed inappropriate WRITE statements from Fortran code.

   o   Fixed: some minor errors in the documentation (expressions for quantile
       functions in help topics 'cdfgev', 'cdfglo', 'cdfgpa', and 'cdfkap').


Version 1.5     2009 Nov 16

   o   Quantile functions drawn by evplot() now extend across the entire
       x range of the plot (previously, with 'par("xaxs")' at its default
       value "r", gaps were left at the sides of the plot).

   o   lmrexp(), lmrgam(), lmrgev(), lmrglo(), lmrgno(), lmrgpa(), lmrgum(),
       lmrkap(), lmrnor(), lmrpe3(), lmrwak(), pelp(), and pelq() now have
       a different specification of the default values for some of their
       arguments.  The actual usage of the functions is unchanged.  The change
       was made so that the help files can avoid the use of a "\synopsis"
       section, which was giving unintended results in R 2.10.0.


Version 1.4     2009 Jul 10

   o   New functions lmrdpoints() and lmrdlines(), to add points or lines
       to an existing L-moment ratio diagram.

   o   evplot.default() is now exported from the package namespace.


Version 1.3     2009 Apr 30

   o   evplot() is now a generic function, with (only) a default method.
       (Further methods will be defined in package lmomRFA, version 2.0.)

   o   evplot(), when argument 'qfunc' is present but 'para' is missing, no
       longer gives an error but instead uses default values for the parameters
       of the distribution, i.e. internally it calls function 'qfunc' with only
       one argument.

       evdistp() and evdistq(), when argument 'para' is missing, act similarly.

   o   lmrd(), when 'x' is supplied but not 'y', now tries to identify
       L-skewness and L-kurtosis elements in 'x' by name rather than by
       position.

   o   lmrd() now recognizes distribution identifiers ("GEV", etc.) in either
       upper or lower case.

   o   lmrd() gains an argument 'cex', to control the size of plotted points.

   o   lmrd(), when given an argument 'col' of length 1, will apply it
       to the plotted points rather than to all the lines.

   o   samlmu() and samlmu.s() give a more direct error message when their
       first argument is not numeric.

   o   Fixed: evplot() would sometimes not honour the y-axis limits supplied
       in 'ylim'.  Specifically, if argument 'qfunc' was specified, the y-axis
       limits would be extended if necessary to include the range of quantile
       values plotted.

   o   Fixed: lmrd() would set default y axis limits based on the values
       of 'x', not of 'y'.


Version 1.2     2009 Mar 16

   o   Default parameter values for the Weibull distribution are now 'c(0,1,1)'.
       (The previous default, 'c(0,1,0)', used an invalid value for the third
       parameter.)  Functions affected: cdfwei(), lmrwei(), quawei().

   o   Fixed: cdfgum() gave incorrect results.


Version 1.1     2008 Dec 23

   o   New functions, for the Weibull distribution: cdfwei(), lmrwei(),
       pelwei(), quawei().

   o   New functions, for the 3-parameter lognormal distribution: cdfln3(),
       lmrln3(), pelln3(), qualn3().  pelln3() also permits parameter
       estimation for the 2-parameter lognormal distribution.

   o   Fixed: pelp() and pelq() would fail when the name of the
       optimization routine (argument 'method') was also the name
       of an object in the global environment.
